# Basic if statement structure:
if [ condition ]; then
    # Commands to execute if the condition is true

# Common test flags for string comparisons:
[ -z "$string" ]         # True if the string is empty
[ -n "$string" ]         # True if the string is not empty
[ "$string1" = "$string2" ]   # True if the strings are equal
[ "$string1" != "$string2" ]  # True if the strings are not equal

# Common test flags for file attributes:
[ -e "$file" ]           # True if the file exists
[ -f "$file" ]           # True if the file exists and is a regular file
[ -d "$dir" ]            # True if the directory exists
[ -r "$file" ]           # True if the file is readable
[ -w "$file" ]           # True if the file is writable
[ -x "$file" ]           # True if the file is executable

# Numeric comparisons:
[ "$num1" -eq "$num2" ]  # True if num1 is equal to num2
[ "$num1" -ne "$num2" ]  # True if num1 is not equal to num2
[ "$num1" -lt "$num2" ]  # True if num1 is less than num2
[ "$num1" -le "$num2" ]  # True if num1 is less than or equal to num2
[ "$num1" -gt "$num2" ]  # True if num1 is greater than num2
[ "$num1" -ge "$num2" ]  # True if num1 is greater than or equal to num2

# Logical operators:
[ condition1 ] && [ condition2 ]   # True if both conditions are true
[ condition1 ] || [ condition2 ]   # True if either condition1 or condition2 is true
! [ condition ]                     # True if the condition is false

# Combining multiple conditions:
if [ condition1 ] && [ condition2 ]; then
    # Commands to execute if both conditions are true
elif [ condition3 ] || [ condition4 ]; then
    # Commands to execute if either condition3 or condition4 is true
else
    # Commands to execute if none of the conditions are true
